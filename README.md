Modern, dark‑themed company landing page for KITSUNE. Built as a static site with Tailwind CSS utilities, subtle animations, and a project showcase.

## Features
- Hero section with CTA buttons and terminal‑style accent
- Services/skills grid and featured projects
- About section with animated logo treatment
- Contact section with cards and form
- Dark‑mode styling and smooth transitions

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (light interactivity)
- Font Awesome (icons)

## Getting Started
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

```

Run locally (if a dev script exists in `package.json`):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or open the file directly in a browser:
```
public/index.html
```

## Project Structure
- `public/` — static assets and the main `index.html`
